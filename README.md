# TitanicSurvivalApp
It is a simple Machine Learning model and a GUI.
You can enter your own informations and see if you would survive Titanic !

I got all datas from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file?rvi=1)
I was inspired from youtube.com/@alejandro_ao

I used "streamlit" library for making 'web site app', I used "pandas" library for data preprocessing and "joblib" library for load existing model which I created.
ChatGPT helped me for small CSS codes.
